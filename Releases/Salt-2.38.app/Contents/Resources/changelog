VERSION 0.163 (Pre-Release)
- Front-end functionality to OpenSSL embedded binary
- Functionality for AES, BF, CAST, RC encryption/decryption
- Functionality for MD, MDC2, RIPEMD, SHA
- Summary that updates ten times per second to reflect the options selected by the user

KNOWN BUGS/TODO IN 0.163
- The initiate button would not disable if the synthesised command would cause openssl to fail (no error checking for directories/overwrite etc)
- DES was not implemented (too tedious)
- Error identification was not implemented

VERSION 1.72 (Initial Release)
- Hash mode will now disable the output field and change the text “Passphrase” to “Hash”, hide the passphrase textfield and replace it with a label where the hash would be printed
- Added initiate-button disabling for problems that would commonly cause openssl to fail
- Added identification for errors, which would show in the summary field (though this should not happen because of error checking that disables the initiate button)
  - unknown errors should show up in the summary field as ‘unknown error’

KNOWN BUGS/TODO IN 1.72
- DES was not implemented

VERSION 2.24
- DES was finally implemented
- Removed Print/Page Setup Options
- Added energy efficiency measures that pauses the timer when the application is not in focus
- implemented 1 and 8 bit AES CFB encryption
- fixed bad decrypt error identification (obtaining task output was done ***before*** the task had finished)
- Added focus rings for relevant buttons
- Added checking for relative paths (if relativepath the initiate button cannot be clicked)

KNOWN BUGS/TODO IN 2
- spaces in filenames do not function as expected
- crypt integration for directories?
- disable button upon nstask initiation

VERSION 2.38
- spaces in filenames now work as expected (added 'quotes' around command arguments)
- the initiate button is now disabled when NSTask is running and displays some status
- crypt for directories cannot be integrated in a nice manner because the program would have no way to determine if the decrypted file is a .tar archive (the user may change the extension etc)

KNOWN BUGS
- the tab ordering/nextKeyView does not seem to function correctly:
  - intended sequence is as follows:
    - pathOutlet - browsePathButton - outputOutlet - browseOutputButton
  - however, the current sequence is as follows:
    - pathOutlet - outputOutlet - browsePathButton - browseOutputButton
